GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'sys_rst_n_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
